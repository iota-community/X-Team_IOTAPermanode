## ðŸŒ³ IOTA Permanode Initiative

The **IOTA Permanode Initiative** is a collaborative effort to help people in the IOTA Community by introducing consistent workflows around [IOTA Permanode](https://blog.iota.org/introducing-chronicle-a-permanode-solution-8e506a2e0813?gi=99179144f686) with content, and open source contributions.

IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger technology that allows [connected devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_Devices) to transfer data and [IOTA tokens](https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/0.1/clients/token) among each other for zero fees.

## ðŸŽ¯ Initiative Goals

The IOTA Permanode is an alpha implementation. We are currently focused on improving the IOTA Experience around the following goals:

- Proof of correctness (enforce design by contract)
- Testings and feedbacks
- Benchmark
- User experience sharing
- Documentation
- Developing new user cases
- Feature suggestions

## ðŸ¤” How Can You Get Involved?

Show your interest by adding your information with an issue here on github and join the IOTA Experience Team on the [IOTA Discord](https://discord.iota.org).

## ðŸ‘¥ What to expect?

Meet with IOTA Foundation members to exchange ideas, give and receive feedback for the chosen goal(s).

This initiative is possible thanks to the contribution of the IOTA Community members and participants will be invited to participate in feedback collecting and evaluating sessions to further push the capabilities of the IOTA Experience Teams.
